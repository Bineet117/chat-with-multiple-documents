### **How to Explain Your AI-Powered PDF Chatbot Project to an Interviewer**  

#### **1️⃣ Problem Statement (Why this project?)**  
👉 "Extracting relevant information from large PDFs is a tedious and time-consuming process. Users often struggle with searching for specific answers within lengthy documents. To solve this, I built an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to ask questions and get instant, context-aware responses from their uploaded PDFs."  

#### **2️⃣ High-Level Solution (What does it do?)**  
👉 "My project leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to process PDFs, store vector embeddings, and retrieve the most relevant text before generating responses using GPT. It supports multiple modes—strict PDF context, hybrid (PDF + general knowledge), and AI-only—to enhance flexibility."

## **3️⃣ Step-by-Step Breakdown**  

### **🔹 Step 1: File Upload & Processing**  
- Users upload PDFs via a **Streamlit UI**.  
- The PDFs are loaded using `PyPDFLoader`, and text is extracted for further processing.  

### **🔹 Step 2: Chunking & Embedding Creation**  
- The text is divided into meaningful chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to ensure logical segmentation.  
- Each chunk is then converted into an **embedding vector** using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model for efficient search.  

**🚧 Challenge:** Initially, the chatbot struggled with retrieving complete answers because chunk sizes were too small. I had to fine-tune the chunk size and overlap to ensure better context retention.  

### **🔹 Step 3: Storing & Retrieving Information**  
- The embeddings are stored in **FAISS**, an efficient vector database optimized for similarity search.  
- When a user asks a question, FAISS retrieves the most relevant text chunks.  

**🚧 Challenge:** One issue I faced was that FAISS retrieval sometimes returned irrelevant chunks. To fix this, I adjusted the similarity search parameters and added metadata filtering for better accuracy.  

### **🔹 Step 4: Conversational AI (RAG Workflow)**  
- The retrieved context is passed to a **GPT model** (`gpt-4-turbo` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`).  
- The chatbot **generates responses** using both the retrieved document context and prior chat history.  

**🚧 Challenge:** The chatbot occasionally generated hallucinated responses when the retrieved chunks lacked sufficient context. To mitigate this, I implemented a confidence threshold—ensuring that responses were only generated when relevant context was found.  

### **🔹 Step 5: Multi-Mode Context Handling**  
- **Strict Mode:** Uses only PDF data for responses.  
- **Flexible Mode:** Uses both PDF data and general knowledge.  
- **Outside Context Mode:** Uses only GPT without relying on PDFs.  

**🚧 Challenge:** Initially, responses were inconsistent across different modes. I had to refine the logic by clearly defining when and how each mode should retrieve information.  

### **🔹 Step 6: UI & User Interaction**  
- Responses are displayed in a conversational format with chat history maintained via `st.session_state`.  
- Users get a seamless experience with interactive inputs and real-time responses.

## **4️⃣ Key Takeaways & Impact**  

✅ **Enhanced Information Retrieval:** "Users can now interact with PDFs conversationally, reducing time spent on manual searches."  
✅ **RAG & Vector Search Expertise:** "I gained hands-on experience with **FAISS, OpenAI embeddings, and LangChain** for retrieval-based AI applications."  
✅ **Optimized Response Quality:** "Through iterative improvements, I fine-tuned chunking, similarity search, and response validation to improve accuracy."  
✅ **User-Friendly Design:** "The chatbot is designed with a clean UI and multiple response modes for flexibility."
